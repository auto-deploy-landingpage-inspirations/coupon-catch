The development of Coupon Catch was driven by the goal to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for managing coupons. By choosing Ionic React, we were able to significantly reduce development costs and streamline the app's availability across both Apple and Android platforms. Our adoption of Google Cloud's Document AI for OCR processing and Firebase for authentication, database, and storage solutions not only improved the app's performance but also expedited our time-to-market.

## Optimizations

*Cloud Vision API replaced with Google Cloud Document AI for more efficient OCR handling
*Lookahead and Lookbehind to reduce regex algorithm run time
*Stripe webhook triggers for user auth
*Firebase auth, storage, and database to reduce time to market
*Postman utilized to reduce API endpoint debugging

## Lessons Learned:

This project was a significant learning experience, deepening our understanding of mobile app development and the integration of native device features. It highlighted the importance of selecting the right tools and technologies to meet project goals effectively. Looking forward, we may explore upgrading the server architecture to Go (Golang) to further improve backend efficiency.

// Triggered When: There are any updates to a subscription (e.g., plan changes, pauses, or resumptions).

// Use Case: Useful for tracking changes in subscription status, like upgrades, downgrades, or pauses, which might affect the user's standing or access to services.




// Handling customer.subscription.updated for Validating Paying Users
// When this event is triggered, your primary goal should be to update your system's records to reflect the current state of the user's subscription. Hereâ€™s a typical approach:

// Identify the User: Extract the user's ID or relevant identifier from the event data.

// Check Subscription Status: Examine the status field of the subscription object. Key statuses include:

// active: The user is in good standing and has a valid, paid subscription.
// past_due: Payments are pending, indicating potential issues with the user's payment method.
// cancelled: The subscription has been cancelled.
// trialing: The user is in a trial period.
// Update User Records: Based on the status, update your database (like Firestore) to reflect the user's current subscription status. For example, you might have a field in your user records indicating whether the user is a current, paying subscriber.

// Handle Plan or Quantity Changes: If the event indicates a change in the plan or quantity, adjust your records accordingly. This might affect the user's access levels or features available to them within your application.

// Manage Expirations and Renewals: If your application handles renewals or expiration dates, update these dates based on the new subscription information.

// Notify the User (Optional): In some cases, you might want to notify the user of the changes to their subscription, especially if it affects their access or billing.

// Logging and Error Handling: Ensure that these operations are wrapped in appropriate error handling and logging mechanisms for debugging and auditing purposes.
